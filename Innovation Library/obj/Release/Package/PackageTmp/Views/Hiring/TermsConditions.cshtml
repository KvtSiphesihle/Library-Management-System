        The terms and conditions for hiring equipment can vary depending on the specific
        equipment and the company providing the rental service. However, here are some general
        terms and conditions that may be included in an equipment rental agreement:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Rental period</b>: The rental period will be clearly defined, including the start and
            end date and time of the rental period. Any extensions to the rental period should be
            agreed upon in writing.
        </li>


        <li>
            <b>Payment</b>: The rental fee and any additional charges (such as delivery, setup, or cleaning fees)
            will be clearly outlined. The method of payment and any required deposit or upfront
            payment will also be specified.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Equipment condition</b>: The equipment will be rented in good working condition and
            will be free of defects. The renter will be responsible for inspecting the equipment
            before and after the rental period and reporting any damages or defects to the rental
            Library.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Use of equipment</b>: The renter will be responsible for using the equipment in a safe and
            appropriate manner, in accordance with any instructions or guidelines provided by
            the rental Library. The equipment should only be used for its intended purpose and should
            not be modified or altered in any way.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Liability and insurance</b>: The renter will be responsible for any damage or loss to the
            equipment during the rental period. The renter may be required to provide proof of
            insurance or purchase insurance coverage through the rental Library.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Return of equipment</b>: The renter will be responsible for returning the equipment to the
            rental Library at the end of the rental period, in the same condition as it was rented.
            Late fees may apply for equipment returned after the agreed-upon rental period.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Termination</b>: The rental company may terminate the rental agreement at any time if
            the renter breaches any of the terms and conditions, or if the equipment is used in a
            manner that violates any laws or regulations.
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Governing law</b>: The rental agreement will be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction
            in which the rental Library is located.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        These are just some of the common terms and conditions that may be included in an
        equipment rental agreement. It is important to carefully review and understand all terms
        and conditions before signing an agreement to rent equipment.
